# SkillShareChain: A Decentralized Peer-to-Peer Skill Exchange

Our vision is a decentralized global classroom on **Aptos**. We empower anyone to teach and learn securely through a trustless on-chain protocol, replacing platform fees with transparent rules for a fairer knowledge economy for all.

**SkillShareChain** is a decentralized application (**dApp**) built on the Aptos blockchain that facilitates a trustless marketplace for peer-to-peer skill sharing. The platform connects learners with expert teachers, using a secure, on-chain escrow and communication protocol to ensure fair and transparent interactions without requiring a central intermediary.

## Key Features

- **Decentralized Identity**: Users control their own data and profiles via their Aptos wallet.
- **Trustless Escrow**: A 1 APT lesson fee is held securely in an on-chain escrow, only released upon mutual agreement.
- **Secure Contact Exchange**: Private contact information is only revealed after a financial commitment (payment deposit) is made.
- **On-Chain Accountability**: A 24-hour response window and learner-controlled reporting ensure teachers remain responsive.
- **Low Fees**: Operates with minimal transaction fees, removing costly platform commissions.
- **Transparent & Auditable**: All interactions and transactions are public and verifiable on the Aptos blockchain.

## The User Flow

### The Happy Path (Successful Lesson)

This flow outlines a successful interaction from start to finish.

1. **Registration**: Alice (Learner) and Bob (Teacher) each connect their wallet and create a profile on SkillShareChain. Bob adds "React Development" to his list of skills.
2. **Discovery & Request**: Alice finds Bob and sends him a request to learn "React Development".
3. **Acceptance**: Bob sees the request in his dashboard and accepts it.
4. **Payment Deposit**: The lesson now appears in Alice's "Lessons" tab. She clicks "Pay 1 APT", which deposits the funds into the smart contract's escrow.
5. **Payment Acknowledgment**: Bob is notified of the payment. He acknowledges it, which triggers the secure exchange of their private contact information.
6. **Communication & Lesson**: Alice and Bob connect off-chain (e.g., via Discord). After they connect, Alice clicks "Mark as Teacher Contacted Me" on the platform.
7. **Completion Request**: Once the lesson is over, Bob clicks "Request Payment Release".
8. **Confirmation & Payment Release**: Alice confirms the lesson was completed. The smart contract automatically releases the 1 APT from escrow to Bob's wallet.

### The Refund Path (Unresponsive Teacher)

This flow protects the learner if a teacher is unresponsive.

1. Steps 1â€“5 proceed as normal.
2. **Waiting Period**: Bob fails to contact Alice to start the lesson.
3. **Deadline Exceeded**: After 24 hours, a "Report Non-Response" button appears for Alice.
4. **Report & Refund**: Alice clicks the button to report Bob and then clicks "Claim Refund" to instantly retrieve her 1 APT. The lesson is marked as "Refunded".
